<p>Latex is a markup language, like HTML, that gives you a way to type up mathematical documents that looks clean and professional.</p>
<p>It is widely used in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) disciplines to produce documents that include mathematical notation, like publications, theses, and books.</p>
<p>However, it can also be used type up homework assignments or produce organized lecture notes. It allows you to easily save and edit your “source code”, which you can then easily use to generate PDFs or even web pages.</p>
<p>Latex is also widely used across academia, so this is a particularly good tool to know for those who are considering graduate school. However, it is also gaining popularity elsewhere - for example, it’s possible to use Latex to produce resumes, reports, or presentations.</p>
<p>This workshop will cover how to set up a Latex environment, how to produce most of the mathematical symbols seen in undergraduate courses, and how generate a completed PDF document.</p>
<p>Please bring a laptop to follow along!</p>
